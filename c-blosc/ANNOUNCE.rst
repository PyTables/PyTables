===============================================================
 Announcing C-Blosc 1.17.1
 A blocking, shuffling and lossless compression library for C
===============================================================

What is new?
============

A maintenance release where LZ4 and Zstd internal codecs have been updated
to latest versions.

For more info, please see the release notes in:

https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.rst


What is it?
===========

Blosc (http://www.blosc.org) is a high performance meta-compressor
optimized for binary data.  It has been designed to transmit data to
the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.

Blosc has internal support for different compressors like its internal
BloscLZ, but also LZ4, LZ4HC, Snappy, Zlib and Zstd.  This way these can
automatically leverage the multithreading and pre-filtering
(shuffling) capabilities that comes with Blosc.
