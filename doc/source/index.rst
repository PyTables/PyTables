===================================
Welcome to PyTable's documentation!
===================================
PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed
to efficiently and easily cope with extremely large amounts of data.
You can download PyTables and use it for free. You can access documentation,
some examples of use and presentations here.

PyTables is built on top of the HDF5 library, using the Python language
and the NumPy package. It features an object-oriented interface that,
combined with C extensions for the performance-critical parts of the
code (generated using Cython), makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to
use tool for interactively browse, process and search very large amounts
of data. One important feature of PyTables is that it optimizes memory and
disk resources so that data takes much less space (specially if on-flight
compression is used) than other solutions such as relational or object
oriented databases.

You can have a look at the MainFeatures of PyTables. Also, find more info
by reading the PyTables FAQ.

PyTables development is a continuing effort and we are always looking for
more developers, testers, and users.  If you are interested in being
involved with this project, please contact us via `github`_ or the
mailing list.

The source code for PyTables may be found at the `GitHub project site`_.
Or you may simply branch from the master branch using git::
