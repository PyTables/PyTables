Changes from 3.7.0 to 3.8.0
===========================

Improvements
------------
- Support for Python 3.11 has been added (:PR:`962`).
- Support for Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 has been dropped (:PR:`966`).
- Added a new (registered) HDF5 filter for Blosc2 compressor (:PR:`969`).
- Added optimized paths for Blosc2 reading and writing in tables. This
  bypasses the HDF5 filter pipeline by building the Blosc2 CFrames and
  sending them to the HDF5 direct chunking machinery (:PR:`969`).
- Internal C-Blosc sources updated to 1.21.2.
- Thanks to Oscar Gui√±on, Francesc Alted for implementing Blosc2 the
  support and NumFOCUS for providing a grant for that.

Other changes
-------------
- Starting form this release, C source files generated by Cython are no
  longer included in the source distribution package.
- Pre-built HTML documentation is no longer included in the source package.
