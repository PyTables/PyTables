Condition Syntax
================
.. currentmodule:: tables

Conditions in PyTables are used in methods related with in-kernel
and indexed searches such as :meth:`Table.where` or :meth:`Table.readWhere`.
They are interpreted using
Numexpr, a powerful package for achieving C-speed computation of array
operations (see :ref:`[NUMEXPR] <NUMEXPR>`).

A condition on a table is just a *string*
containing a Python expression involving *at least one
column*, and maybe some constants and external variables, all
combined with algebraic operators and functions. The result of a valid
condition is always a *boolean array* of the same
length as the table, where the *i*-th element is true
if the value of the expression on the *i*-th row of
the table evaluates to true

That is the reason why multidimensional fields in a table are
not supported in conditions, since the truth value of each resulting
multidimensional boolean value is not obvious.
. Usually, a method using a condition will only consider
the rows where the boolean result is true.

For instance, the condition 'sqrt(x*x + y*y) <
1' applied on a table with x and
y columns consisting of floating point numbers
results in a boolean array where the *i*-th element
is true if (unsurprisingly) the value of the square root of the sum of
squares of x and y is less than 1.
The sqrt() function works element-wise, the 1
constant is adequately broadcast to an array of ones of the length of
the table for evaluation, and the *less than*
operator makes the result a valid boolean array. A condition like
'mycolumn' alone will not usually be valid, unless
mycolumn is itself a column of scalar, boolean
values.

In the previous conditions, mycolumn,
x and y are examples of
*variables* which are associated with columns.
Methods supporting conditions do usually provide their own ways of
binding variable names to columns and other values. You can read the
documentation of :meth:`Table.where` for more information on that. Also, please
note that the names None, True and
False, besides the names of functions (see below)
*can not be overridden*, but you can always define
other new names for the objects you intend to use.

Values in a condition may have the following types:

- 8-bit boolean (bool).

- 32-bit signed integer (int).

- 64-bit signed integer (long).

- 32-bit, single-precision floating point number
  (float or float32).

- 64-bit, double-precision floating point number
  (double or float64).

- 2x64-bit, double-precision complex number
  (complex).

- Raw string of bytes (str).

Nevertheless, if the type passed is not among the above ones, it
will be silently upcasted, so you don't need to worry too much about
passing supported types, except for the Unsigned 64 bits integer,
that cannot be upcasted to any of the supported types.

However, the types in PyTables conditions are somewhat stricter
than those of Python. For instance, the *only* valid
constants for booleans are True and
False, and they are *never*
automatically cast to integers. The type strengthening also affects the
availability of operators and functions. Beyond that, the usual type
inference rules apply.

Conditions support the set of operators listed below:

- Logical operators: &, \|, ~.

- Comparison operators: <, <=, ==, !=, >=, >.

- Unary arithmetic operators: -.

- Binary arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, \**, %.

Types do not support all operators. Boolean values
only support logical and strict (in)equality comparison operators, while
strings only support comparisons, numbers do not work with logical
operators, and complex comparisons can only check for strict
(in)equality. Unsupported operations (including invalid castings) raise
NotImplementedError exceptions.

You may have noticed the special meaning of the usually bitwise
operators &, | and ~. Because of the way Python handles the
short-circuiting of logical operators and the truth values of their
operands, conditions must use the bitwise operator equivalents instead.
This is not difficult to remember, but you must be careful because
bitwise operators have a *higher precedence* than
logical operators. For instance, 'a and b == c'
(*a is true AND b is
equal to c*) is *not*
equivalent to 'a & b == c'
(*a AND b is equal to
c)*. The safest way to avoid confusions is
to *use parentheses* around logical operators, like
this: 'a & (b == c)'. Another effect of
short-circuiting is that expressions like '0 < x <
1' will *not* work as expected; you should
use '(0 < x) & (x < 1)'

All of this may be solved if Python supported overloadable
boolean operators (see PEP 335) or some kind of non-shortcircuiting
boolean operators (like C's &&, || and !).

You can also use the following functions in conditions:

- where(bool, number1, number2): number - number1 if the bool
  condition is true, number2 otherwise.

- {sin,cos,tan}(float|complex):
  float|complex - trigonometric sine, cosine or
  tangent.

- {arcsin,arccos,arctan}(float|complex):
  float|complex - trigonometric inverse sine, cosine or
  tangent.

- arctan2(float1, float2): float - trigonometric inverse tangent of
  float1/float2.

- {sinh,cosh,tanh}(float|complex):
  float|complex - hyperbolic sine, cosine or
  tangent.

- {arcsinh,arccosh,arctanh}(float|complex):
  float|complex - hyperbolic inverse sine, cosine or
  tangent.

- {log,log10,log1p}(float|complex):
  float|complex - natural, base-10
  and log(1+x) logarithms.

- {exp,expm1}(float|complex):
  float|complex - exponential and exponential minus
  one.

- sqrt(float|complex): float|complex - square root.

- {abs}(float|complex): float|complex - absolute value.

- {real,imag}(complex): float - real or
  imaginary part of complex.

- complex(float, float): complex - complex
  from real and imaginary parts.
