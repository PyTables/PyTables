    Make things as simple as possible, but not any simpler.

    -- Albert Einstein


The Python Distutils are used to build and
install PyTables, so it is fairly simple to get the application up and
running. If you want to install the package from sources you can go on
reading to the next section.

However, if you are running Windows and want to install
precompiled binaries, you can jump straight to :ref:`binaryInstallationDescr`. In
addition, binary packages are available for many different Linux
distributions, MacOSX and other Unices.  Just check the package
repository for your preferred operating system.

Installation from source
------------------------

These instructions are for both Unix/MacOS X and Windows
systems. If you are using Windows, it is assumed that you have a
recent version of MS Visual C++ compiler installed.
A GCC compiler is assumed for Unix, but other
compilers should work as well.

Extensions in PyTables have been developed in Cython (see :ref:`[CYTHON] <CYTHON>`)
and the C language. You can rebuild
everything from scratch if you have Cython installed, but this is not
necessary, as the Cython compiled source is included in the source
distribution.

To compile PyTables you will need a recent version of Python,
the HDF5 (C flavor) library from `http://hdfgroup.org/ <http://hdfgroup.org/>`_,
and the NumPy (see :ref:`[NUMPY] <NUMPY>`)
and Numexpr (see :ref:`[NUMEXPR] <NUMEXPR>`)
packages. Although you won't need numarray
(see :ref:`[NUMARRAY] <NUMARRAY>`) or Numeric
(see :ref:`[NUMERIC] <NUMERIC>`) in order to compile PyTables, they
are supported; you only need a reasonably recent version of them
(>= 1.5.2 for numarray and >= 24.2 for Numeric) if you plan on
using them in your applications. If you already have
numarray and/or Numeric
installed, the test driver module will detect them and will run the
tests for numarray and/or
Numeric automatically.

.. warning:: The use of numarray and
   Numeric in PyTables is now deprecated.
   Support for these packages will be dropped in future versions.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that you have at least Python 2.4, HDF5
1.6.10, NumPy 1.4.1, Numexpr 1.4.1 and Cython 0.13 or higher
installed (for testing purposes, we are using HDF5 1.6.10/1.8.5,
NumPy 1.5 and Numexpr 1.4.1 currently). If you don't, fetch and
install them before proceeding.

Compile and install these packages (but see :ref:`prerequisitesBinInst` for
instructions on how to install precompiled binaries if you are not
willing to compile the prerequisites on Windows systems).

For compression (and possibly improved performance), you will
need to install the Zlib (see :ref:`[ZLIB] <ZLIB>`), which is also required by HDF5 as
well. You may also optionally install the
excellent LZO compression library (see :ref:`[LZO] <LZO>`
and :ref:`compressionIssues`). The high-performance bzip2
compression library can also be used with PyTables (see :ref:`[BZIP2] <BZIP2>`).
The Blosc (see :ref:`[BLOSC] <BLOSC>`) compression library is
embedded in PyTables, so you don't need to install it
separately.

**Unix**

    setup.py will detect HDF5,
    LZO, or bzip2 libraries
    and include files under :file:`/usr`
    or :file:`/usr/local`; this will cover most manual
    installations as well as installations from
    packages. If setup.py can not find
    libhdf5, libhdf5
    (or liblzo, or libbz2 that you may wish to use) or if you have
    several versions of a
    library installed and want to use a particular one, then you
    can set the path to the resource in the environment, by
    setting the values of the :envvar:`HDF5_DIR`, :envvar:`LZO_DIR`,
    or :envvar:`BZIP2_DIR` environment variables to the
    path to the particular resource. You may also specify the
    locations of the resource root directories on the
    setup.py command line. For example::

        --hdf5=/stuff/hdf5-1.8.5
        --lzo=/stuff/lzo-2.02
        --bzip2=/stuff/bzip2-1.0.5

    If your HDF5 library was built as a shared library not
    in the runtime load path, then you can specify the additional
    linker flags needed to find the shared library on the command
    line as well. For example::

        --lflags="-Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /stuff/hdf5-1.8.5/lib"

    You may also want to try setting the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
    environment variable to point to the directory where the
    shared libraries can be found. Check your compiler and linker
    documentation as well as the Python
    Distutils documentation for the correct
    syntax or environment variable names.
    It is also possible to link with specific libraries by
    setting the :envvar:`LIBS` environment
    variable::

        LIBS="hdf5-1.8.5 nsl"

    Finally, you can give additional flags to your compiler
    by passing them to the :option:`--cflags`
    flag::

        --cflags="-w -O3 -msse2"

    In the above case, a gcc compiler is
    used and you instructed it to suppress all the warnings and
    set the level 3 of optimization.  Finally, if you are running
    Linux in 32-bit mode, and you know that your CPU has support
    for SSE2 vector instructions, you may want to pass
    the :option:`-msse2` flag that will accelerate Blosc
    operation.

**Windows**

    You can get ready-to-use Windows binaries and other
    development files for most of the following libraries from the
    GnuWin32 project (see :ref:`[GNUWIN32] <GNUWIN32>`).  In
    case you cannot find the LZO binaries in the GnuWin32
    repository, you can find them at
    `http://www.pytables.org/download/lzo-win <http://www.pytables.org/download/lzo-win>`_.
    Once you have installed the prerequisites,
    setup.py needs to know where the necessary
    library *stub* (.lib)
    and *header* (.h) files
    are installed. You can set the path to the
    include and dll
    directories for the HDF5 (mandatory) and
    LZO or BZIP2 (optional) libraries in the environment, by
    setting the values of the :envvar:`HDF5_DIR`, :envvar:`LZO_DIR`,
    or :envvar:`BZIP2_DIR` environment variables to the
    path to the particular resource.  For example::

        set HDF5_DIR=c:\\stuff\\hdf5-1.8.5-32bit-VS2008-IVF101\\release
        set LZO_DIR=c:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32
        set BZIP2_DIR=c:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32

    You may also specify the locations of the resource root
    directories on the setup.py command line.
    For example::

        --hdf5=c:\\stuff\\hdf5-1.8.5-32bit-VS2008-IVF101\\release
        --lzo=c:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32
        --bzip2=c:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32

PyTables package installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have installed the HDF5 library and the NumPy and
Numexpr packages, you can proceed with the PyTables package
itself.

#. Run this command from the main PyTables distribution
   directory, including any extra command line arguments as
   discussed above::

      python setup.py build_ext --inplace

#. To run the test suite, execute any of these
   commands.

   **Unix**
      In the sh shell and its
      variants::

          PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH  python tables/tests/test_all.py

      or, if you prefer::

          PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH  python -c "import tables; tables.test()"

   **Windows**

      Open the command prompt (cmd.exe
      or command.com) and type::

          set PYTHONPATH=.;%PYTHONPATH%
          python tables\\tests\\test_all.py

      or::

          set PYTHONPATH=.;%PYTHONPATH%
          python -c "import tables; tables.test()"

   Both commands do the same thing, but the latter still
   works on an already installed PyTables (so, there is no need to
   set the PYTHONPATH variable for this case).  However, before
   installation, the former is recommended because it is more
   flexible, as you can see below.
   If you would like to see verbose output from the tests
   simply add the :option:`-v` flag and/or the word
   verbose to the first of the command lines
   above. You can also run only the tests in a particular test
   module. For example, to execute just the
   test_types test suite, you only have to
   specify it::

      python tables/tests/test_types.py -v  # change to backslashes for win

   You have other options to pass to the
   :file:`test_all.py` driver::

      python tables/tests/test_all.py --heavy  # change to backslashes for win

   The command above runs every test in the test unit. Beware, it
   can take a lot of time, CPU and memory resources to complete::

      python tables/tests/test_all.py --print-versions  # change to backslashes for win

   The command above shows the versions for all the packages that
   PyTables relies on. Please be sure to include this when
   reporting bugs::

      python tables/tests/test_all.py --show-memory  # only under Linux 2.6.x

   The command above prints out the evolution of the memory
   consumption after each test module completion. It's useful for
   locating memory leaks in PyTables (or packages behind it). Only
   valid for Linux 2.6.x kernels.
   And last, but not least, in case a test fails, please run
   the failing test module again and enable the verbose output::

      python tables/tests/test_<module>.py -v verbose

   and, very important, obtain your PyTables version information by
   using the :option:`--print-versions` flag (see above)
   and send back both outputs to developers so that we may continue
   improving PyTables.
   If you run into problems because Python can not load the
   HDF5 library or other shared libraries.

   **Unix**

      Try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent
      environment variable to point to the directory where the
      missing libraries can be found.

   **Windows**

      Put the DLL libraries
      (hdf5dll.dll and, optionally,
      lzo1.dll and
      bzip2.dll) in a directory listed in
      your :envvar:`PATH` environment variable. The
      setup.py installation program will
      print out a warning to that effect if the libraries can
      not be found.

#. To install the entire PyTables Python package, change back
   to the root distribution directory and run the following command
   (make sure you have sufficient permissions to write to the
   directories where the PyTables files will be installed)::

      python setup.py install

   Of course, you will need super-user privileges if you want
   to install PyTables on a system-protected area. You can select,
   though, a different place to install the package using the
   :option:`--prefix` flag::

      python setup.py install --prefix="/home/myuser/mystuff"

   Have in mind, however, that if you use the
   :option:`--prefix` flag to install in a non-standard
   place, you should properly setup your
   :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable, so that the
   Python interpreter would be able to find your new PyTables
   installation.
   You have more installation options available in the
   Distutils package. Issue a::

      python setup.py install --help

   for more information on that subject.

That's it! Now you can skip to the next chapter to learn how
to use PyTables.


.. _binaryInstallationDescr:

Binary installation (Windows)
-----------------------------

This section is intended for installing precompiled binaries on
Windows platforms. You may also find it useful for instructions on how
to install *binary prerequisites* even if you want
to compile PyTables itself on Windows.

.. warning:: Since PyTables 2.2b3, Windows binaries are distributed with
   SSE2 instructions enabled.  If your processor does not have support
   for SSE2, then you will not be able to use these binaries.

.. _prerequisitesBinInst:

Windows prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that you have Python 2.4, NumPy 1.4.1 and
Numexpr 1.4.1 or higher installed (PyTables binaries have been built
using NumPy 1.5 and Numexpr 1.4.1).  The binaries already include
DLLs for HDF5 (1.6.10, 1.8.5), zlib1 (1.2.3), szlib (2.0,
uncompression support only) and bzip2 (1.0.5) for Windows (2.8.0).
The LZO DLL can't be included because of license issues (but read
below for directives to install it if you want so).

To enable compression with the optional LZO library (see the
:ref:`compressionIssues` for
hints about how it may be used to improve performance), fetch and
install the LZO from
`http://www.pytables.org/download/lzo-win <http://www.pytables.org/download/lzo-win>`_ (choose
v1.x for Windows 32-bit and v2.x for Windows 64-bit). Normally, you
will only need to fetch that package and copy the
included lzo1.dll/lzo2.dll file in a directory in
the PATH environment variable (for example
C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM) or
python_installation_path\\Lib\\site-packages\\tables
(the last directory may not exist yet, so if you want to install the
DLL there, you should do so *after* installing
the PyTables package), so that it can be found by the PyTables
extensions.

Please note that PyTables has internal machinery for dealing
with uninstalled optional compression libraries, so, you don't need
to install the LZO dynamic library if you don't want to.

PyTables package installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the
tables-<version>.win32-py<version>.exe
file and execute it.

You can (and *you should*) test your
installation by running the next commands::

    >>> import tables
    >>> tables.test()

on your favorite python shell. If all the
tests pass (possibly with a few warnings, related to the potential
unavailability of LZO lib) you already have a working,
well-tested copy of PyTables installed! If any test fails, please
copy the output of the error messages as well as the output of::

    >>> tables.print_versions()

and mail them
to the developers so that the problem can be fixed in future
releases.

You can proceed now to the next chapter to see how to use
PyTables.
