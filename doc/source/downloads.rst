Stable Versions
---------------

The stable versions of PyTables can be downloaded from
https://pypi.org/project/tables/.

The documentation in both HTML and PDF formats can be downloaded from
https://readthedocs.org/projects/pytables.

A *pure source* version of the package (mainly intended for developers and
packagers) is available on the `tags page`_ on GitHub.  It contains all files
under SCM but not the (generated) files.

You may be interested to install the latest released stable version::

    $ pip install tables

Or, you may prefer to install the stable version in Git repository
using :program:`pip`. For example, for the stable 3.1 series, you can do::

    $ pip install --install-option='--prefix=<PREFIX>' \
    -e git+https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables.git@v.3.1#egg=tables
