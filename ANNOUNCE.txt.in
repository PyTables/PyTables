 Announcing PyTables @VERSION@
===========================

We are happy to announce PyTables @VERSION@.

This is a feature release.  The upgrading is recommended for users that
are running PyTables in production environments.


What's new
==========

Probably the most relevant changes in this release are internal improvements
like the new node cache that is now compatible with the upcoming Python 3.4
and the registry for open files has been deeply reworked. The caching feature
of file handlers has been completely dropped so now PyTables is a little bit
more "thread friendly".

New, user visible, features include:

- a new lossy filter for HDF5 datasets (EArray, CArray, VLArray and Table
  objects). The *quantization* filter truncates floating point data to a
  specified precision before writing to disk.
  This can significantly improve the performance of compressors
  (many thanks to Andreas Hilboll).
- support for the H5FD_SPLIT HDF5 driver (thanks to simleo)
- all new features introduced in the Blosc_ 1.3.x series, and in particular
  the ability to leverage different compressors within Blosc_ are now available
  in PyTables via the blosc filter (a big thank you to Francesc)
- the ability to save/restore the default value of :class:`EnumAtom` types

Also, installations of the HDF5 library that have a broken support for the
*long double* data type (see the `Issues with H5T_NATIVE_LDOUBLE`_ thread on
the HFG5 forum) are detected by PyTables @VERSION@ and the corresponding
features are automatically disabled.

Users that need support for the *long double* data type should ensure to build
PyTables against an installation of the HDF5 library that is not affected by the
bug.

As always, a large amount of bugs have been addressed and squashed as well.

What it is?
===========

PyTables is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  PyTables includes OPSI, a new indexing technology,
allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10 gigarows
(10**10 rows) in less than a tenth of a second.

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy makers.
Without them, PyTables simply would not exist.
