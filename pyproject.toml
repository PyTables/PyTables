PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of
data. PyTables is built on top of the HDF5 library and the
NumPy package and features an object-oriented interface
that, combined with C-code generated from Cython sources,
makes of it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool for
