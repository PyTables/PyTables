.. py:currentmodule:: tables


Changes from 3.7.0 to 3.8.0
===========================

Improvements
------------
- Support for Python 3.11 has been added (PR #962).
- Support for Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 has been dropped (PR #966).
- Added a new (registered) HDF5 filter for Blosc2 compressor (PR #969).
- Added optimized paths for Blosc2 reading and writing in tables. This
  bypasses the HDF5 filter pipeline by building the Blosc2 CFrames and
  sending them to the HDF5 direct chunking machinery (PR #969).
- Internal C-Blosc sources updated to 1.21.2.
- Thanks to Oscar Guiñon, Francesc Alted for implementing Blosc2 the
  support and NumFOCUS for providing a grant for that.

Other changes
-------------
- Starting form this release, C source files generated by Cython are no
  longer included in the source distribution package.
- Pre-built HTML documentation is no longer included in the source package.


Changes from 3.6.1 to 3.7.0
===========================

Improvements
------------
- Compatibility with Python 3.10, numpy 1.21 and HDF5 1.12.
- Support for Python 3.5 has been dropped (:issue:`840` and :issue:`850`).

- Internal C-Blosc sources updated to 1.21.1 (:issue:`931`).
  Note that, starting from C-Blosc 1.19 does not include the Snappy codec

  included sources; other packages (like conda or wheels),
  may (or may not) include it.

- Switch to `git submodule` for the management of vendored c-blosc sources.

  (thanks to Andreas Motl @amotl and Matthias @xmatthias).
