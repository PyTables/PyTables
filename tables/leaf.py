    the B-tree. Large B-trees take memory and causes file storage

    data cache.  You have to balance between memory and I/O overhead
    (small B-trees) and time to access to data (big B-trees).

class Leaf(Node):
    """
    Abstract base class for all PyTables leaves.

    A leaf is a node (see the `Node` class) which hangs from a group
    (see the `Group` class) but, unlike a group, it can not have any
    further children below it (i.e. it is an end node).

    This definition includes all nodes which contain actual data
    (datasets handled by the `Table`, `Array`, `CArray`, `EArray` and
    `VLArray` classes) and unsupported nodes (the `UnImplemented` class)
    --these classes do in fact inherit from `Leaf`.

    Public instance variables
    -------------------------

    The following instance variables are provided in addition to those
    in `Node`:

    byteorder
        The byte ordering of the leaf data *on disk*.
    chunkshape
        The HDF5 chunk size for chunked leaves (a tuple).

        This is read-only because you cannot change the chunk size of a
        leaf once it has been created.
    filters
        Filter properties for this leaf --see `Filters`.
    flavor
        The type of the data object read from this leaf.

        It can be any of 'numpy', 'numarray', 'numeric' or 'python' (the
        set of supported flavors depends on which packages you have
        installed on your system).

        You can (and are encouraged to) use this property to get, set
        and delete the ``FLAVOR`` HDF5 attribute of the leaf.  When the
        leaf has no such attribute, the default flavor is used.
    maindim
        The dimension along which iterators work.

        Its value is 0 (i.e. the first dimension) when the dataset is
        not extendable, and `Leaf.extdim` (where available) for
        extendable ones.
    nrows
        The length of the main dimension of the leaf data.
    nrowsinbuf
        The number of rows that fit in internal input buffers.

        You can change this to fine-tune the speed or memory
        requirements of your application.
    shape
        The shape of data in the leaf.

    Public instance variables -- aliases
    ------------------------------------

    The following instance variables are just easier-to-write aliases to
    their `Node` counterparts (indicated between parentheses):

    attrs
        The associated `AttributeSet` instance (`Node._v_attrs`).
    name
        The name of this node in its parent group (`Node._v_name`).
    objectID
        A node identifier (may change from run to run).
        (`Node._v_objectID`).
    title
        A description for this node (`Node._v_title`).

    Public methods

        Please note that there is no ``recursive`` flag since leaves
        do not have child nodes.  In addition, this method recognises
        the following keyword arguments:

        `title`
            The new title for the destination.  If omitted or
            ``None``, the original title is used.
        `filters`
            Specifying this parameter overrides the original filter
            properties in the source node.  If specified, it must be
            an instance of the `Filters` class.  The default is to
            copy the filter properties from the source node.
        `copyuserattrs`
            You can prevent the user attributes from being copied by
            setting this parameter to ``False``.  The default is to
            copy them.
        `start`, `stop`, `step`
            Specify the range of rows to be copied; the default is to
            copy all the rows.
        `chunkshape`
            The chunkshape of the new leaf.  It supports a couple of
            special values.  A value of 'keep' means that the chunkshape
            will be the same than original leaf (this is the default).
            A value of 'auto' means that a new shape will be computed
            automatically in order to ensure best performance when
            accessing the dataset through the main dimension.  Any other
            value should be an integer or a tuple matching the
            dimensions of the leaf.
        `stats`
            This argument may be used to collect statistics on the
            copy process.  When used, it should be a dictionary whith
            keys ``'groups'``, ``'leaves'`` and ``'bytes'`` having a
            numeric value.  Their values will be incremented to
            reflect the number of groups, leaves and bytes,
            respectively, that have been copied during the operation.

        .. Warning:: Note that unknown parameters passed to this method
           will be ignored, so may want to double check the spell of
           these (i.e. if you write them incorrectly, they will most
