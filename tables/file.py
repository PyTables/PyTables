"""Create PyTables files and the object tree.

        The name of the file (supports environment variable expansion). It is
        suggested that file names have any of the .h5, .hdf or .hdf5
        extensions, although this is not mandatory.
    mode : str
        The mode to open the file. It can be one of the
        following:

            * *'r'*: Read-only; no data can be modified.
            * *'w'*: Write; a new file is created (an existing file with the
              same name would be deleted).
            * *'a'*: Append; an existing file is opened for reading and writing,
              and if the file does not exist it is created.
            * *'r+'*: It is similar to 'a', but the file must already exist.

    title : str
        If the file is to be created, a TITLE string attribute will be set on
        the root group with the given value. Otherwise, the title will be read
        from disk, and this will not have any effect.
    rootUEP : str
        The root User Entry Point. This is a group in the HDF5 hierarchy which
        will be taken as the starting point to create the object tree. It can
        be whatever existing group in the file, named by its HDF5 path. If it
        does not exist, an HDF5ExtError is issued. Use this if you do not want
        to build the *entire* object tree, but rather only a *subtree* of it.
    filters : Filters
        An instance of the Filters (see :ref:`FiltersClassDescr`) class that
        provides information about the desired I/O filters applicable to the
        leaves that hang directly from the *root group*, unless other filter
        properties are specified for these leaves. Besides, if you do not
        specify filter properties for child groups, they will inherit these
        ones, which will in turn propagate to child nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    In addition, it recognizes the names of parameters present in
    :file:`tables/parameters.py` as additional keyword arguments.
    See :ref:`parameter_files` for a detailed info on the supported
    parameters.

    """The in-memory representation of a PyTables file.

    An instance of this class is returned when a PyTables file is
    opened with the :func`tables.openFile` function. It offers methods to
    manipulate (create, rename, delete...) nodes and handle their attributes,
    as well as methods to traverse the object tree. The *user entry
    point* to the object tree attached to the HDF5 file is
    represented in the rootUEP attribute. Other
    attributes are available.

    File objects support an *Undo/Redo mechanism* which can be enabled with the
    :meth:`File.enableUndo` method. Once the Undo/Redo mechanism is
    enabled, explicit *marks* (with an optional unique
    name) can be set on the state of the database using the
    :meth:`File.mark`
    method. There are two implicit marks which are always available: the
    initial mark (0) and the final mark (-1).  Both the identifier of a
    mark and its name can be used in *undo* and
    *redo* operations.

    Hierarchy manipulation operations (node creation, movement and
    removal) and attribute handling operations (setting and deleting) made
    after a mark can be undone by using the :meth:`File.undo` method, which
    returns the database to the
    state of a past mark. If undo() is not followed by
    operations that modify the hierarchy or attributes, the
    :meth:`File.redo` method can
    be used to return the database to the state of a future mark. Else,
    future states of the database are forgotten.

    Note that data handling operations can not be undone nor redone
    by now. Also, hierarchy manipulation operations on nodes that do not
    support the Undo/Redo mechanism issue an
    UndoRedoWarning *before*
    changing the database.

    The Undo/Redo mechanism is persistent between sessions and can
    only be disabled by calling the :meth:`File.disableUndo` method.

    File objects can also act as context managers when using the
    with statement introduced in Python 2.5.  When
    exiting a context, the file is automatically closed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        The name of the file (supports environment variable expansion). It is
        suggested that file names have any of the .h5, .hdf or .hdf5
        extensions, although this is not mandatory.
    mode : str
        The mode to open the file. It can be one of the
        following:

            * *'r'*: Read-only; no data can be modified.
            * *'w'*: Write; a new file is created (an existing file with the
              same name would be deleted).
            * *'a'*: Append; an existing file is opened for reading and writing,
              and if the file does not exist it is created.
            * *'r+'*: It is similar to 'a', but the file must already exist.

            can be any of the following:

                * *A user-defined class*: This should inherit from the
                  IsDescription class (see :ref:`IsDescriptionClassDescr`) where
                  table fields are specified.
                * *A dictionary*: For example, when you do not know beforehand
                  which structure your table will have).
                * *A Description instance*: You can use the description
                  attribute of another table to create a new one with the same
                  structure.
                * *A NumPy dtype*: A completely general structured NumPy dtype.
                * *A NumPy (structured) array instance*: The dtype of this
                  structured array will be used as the description.  Also, in
                  case the array has actual data, it will be injected into the
                  newly created table.
                * *A RecArray instance (deprecated)*: Object from the numarray
                  package.  This does not give you the possibility to create a
                  nested table.  Array data is injected into the new table.

        chunkshape
            The shape of the data chunk to be read or written in a single HDF5
            I/O operation. Filters are applied to those chunks of data. The rank
