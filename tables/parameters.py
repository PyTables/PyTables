# 2.- As more nodes, the re-ordering of the LRU cache takes more time
#     --> less performance
# 3.- As more nodes, the memory needs for PyTables grows, specially for table
#     writings (that could take double of memory than table reads!).
#
# The default value here is quite conservative. If you have a system
# with tons of memory, and if you are touching regularly a very large
# number of leaves, try increasing this value and see if it fits better
# for you. Please report back your feedback.

If positive, this is the number of *unreferenced* nodes to be kept in
the metadata cache. Least recently used nodes are unloaded from memory
when this number of loaded nodes is reached. To load a node again,
simply access it as usual. Nodes referenced by user variables are not
taken into account nor unloaded.

Negative value means that all the touched nodes will be kept in an
internal dictionary.  This is the faster way to load/retrieve nodes.
However, and in order to avoid a large memory comsumption, the user will
be warned when the number of loaded nodes will reach the
``-NODE_CACHE_SLOTS`` value.

Finally, a value of zero means that any cache mechanism is disabled.

Following drivers are implemented:
	H5FD_SEC2 - This is the default driver which uses Posix file-system functions like read and write to perform I/O to a single file.
	H5FD_STDIO - This driver uses functions from 'stdio.h' to perform buffered I/O to a single file.
	H5FD_CORE - This driver performs I/O directly to memory and can be used to create small temporary files that never exist on permanent storage. If the provided filename is set to None, an in memory only file will be created. Additionaly if filename is set to None and H5FD_CORE_INMEMORY_IMAGE parameter is provided the HDF5 will be read from the data provided as a stromg in the H5FD_CORE_INMEMORY_IMAGE.
	H5FD_CORE_INMEMORY - This is a pseudodriver. It makes it possible to read and write in-memory only images of HDF5 files. 
	H5FD_DIRECT - With this driver, data is written to or read from the file synchronously without being cached by the system.
The following drivers may be implemented in the future.
	H5FD_MPIIO - This driver is used with Parallel HDF5, and is only pre-defined if the library is compiled with parallel I/O support. Refer to the Parallel HDF5 Tutorial for more information on using Parallel HDF5.
	H5FD_MULTI- This driver enables different types of HDF5 data and metadata to be written to separate files. The H5FD_SPLIT driver is an example of what the H5FD_MULTI driver can do.
	H5FD_FAMILY - This driver partitions a large format address space into smaller chunks (separate storage of a user's choice).
	H5FD_SPLIT - This driver splits the meta data and raw data into separate storage of a user's choice.
